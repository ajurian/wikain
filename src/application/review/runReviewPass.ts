 *    branch runs to completion (grade/judge → rate → persist).
 *  - LOOP-2: the deterministic (cued) branch grades and ends the pass with no LLM call.
 *  - LOOP-3: the judged (free/maintenance) branch runs the rule layer first; a bounce ends the pass
 *    with no rating and no FSRS update (INV-2). Both behaviours are owned by the dispatched
 *    use-cases — this orchestrator only routes and wraps the result.
 *  - LOOP-5: persistence happens inside the rated branch; a bounce persists nothing (INV-2).
 *
 * The card is loaded once here solely to read its mastery for routing; the dispatched use-case
 * re-loads from the same repository (no staleness in one pass), which keeps both use-cases unchanged.
