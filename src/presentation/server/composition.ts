/**
 * Server-only composition for the deterministic review slice. Imported only by server-function
 * handlers, so the infrastructure (fs / wink / ts-fsrs) never reaches the client bundle.
 *
 * The repository is **URL-gated** (STACK-3, mirroring the judge gate below). With `DATABASE_URL` set we
 * persist to real Postgres via the Drizzle/Neon adapter — durable across restarts, one row per
 * `(user_id, sense_id)` under `currentUserId()`. `neonDbFromEnv()` builds the handle synchronously
 * (lazy connection), so no async composition is needed; the URL is read only here, server-side (NET-7).
 * Unset, we fall back to a process-shared in-memory store so `npm run dev` stays zero-config and fully
 * offline. Either way ONE instance is shared across every server-function call in this process (all
 * three dep-factories close over it), so a session seeded by `startSessionFn` is visible to
 * `submitReviewFn`/`usableCounterFn` in the same running server. BetterAuth (STACK-4) is still deferred
 * (PRAG-1) — every request acts as the dev user via `currentUserId()`.
 *
 * Run `npm run db:migrate` against the Neon instance once before using the `DATABASE_URL` path.
